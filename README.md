# FantasyData

Encapsulates FantasyData's API in a rubygem, currently focusing on the MLB data API

Done for web-dev experience

Looking too closely may induce trauma for those well-versed in Ruby

## Installation

Not on RubyGems yet - this has been [done
before](https://github.com/Drosty/fantasydata), but it only includes the NFL
APIs and it's three years old. The design (as far as I can tell) is very good,
and lot of my design is inspired by it.

## Usage

Not working yet :)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/artemish/fantasydata.

## License
